        "1. What is a Parameter?\n",
        "A parameter in Machine Learning (ML) refers to a variable within a model that is learned from training data. Examples include the weights in a linear regression model or the connection strengths in a neural network.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is Correlation?\n",
        "Correlation measures the relationship between two variables, showing how one variable changes in relation to another. It is expressed using a correlation coefficient (r) ranging from -1 to 1.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What Does Negative Correlation Mean?\n",
        "A negative correlation means that as one variable increases, the other decreases. For example, in a dataset of car mileage, fuel efficiency and fuel consumption are negatively correlated.\n",
